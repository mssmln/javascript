// Copy Array Items Using slice
/*
slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array
leaving the array it is called upon untouched
slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction
and the second is the index at which to stop extraction 
(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index)
