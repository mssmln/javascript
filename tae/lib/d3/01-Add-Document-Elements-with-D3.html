    The select() method selects one element from the document. 
    It takes an argument for the name of the element you want and 
    returns an HTML node for the first element in the document that matches the name.

    The append() method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the document. 
    It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and returns a handle to that node.

    The text() method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the current text. 
    To set the value, you pass a string as an argument inside the parentheses of the method.
