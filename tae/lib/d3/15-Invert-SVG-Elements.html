        You may have noticed the bar chart looked like it's upside-down, or inverted. 
        This is because of how SVG uses (x, y) coordinates.
        In SVG, the origin point for the coordinates is in the upper-left corner. 
        An x coordinate of 0 places a shape on the left edge of the SVG area. 
        A y coordinate of 0 places a shape on the top edge of the SVG area. 
        Higher x values push the rectangle to the right. Higher y values push the rectangle down.
        To make the bars right-side-up, you need to change the way the y coordinate is calculated. 
        It needs to account for both the height of the bar and the total height of the SVG area.
        The y coordinate that is y = heightOfSVG - heightOfBar would place the bars right-side-up.
