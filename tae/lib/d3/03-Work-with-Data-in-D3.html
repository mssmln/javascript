        The data() method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. 
        The data set is passed as an argument to the method.
        A common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. 
        D3 has the enter() method for this purpose.
        When enter() is combined with the data() method, it looks at the selected elements from the page 
        and compares them to the number of data items in the set. 
        If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.

        .selectAll('h2') // returns an empty selection
        .data(dataset) // reviews the dataset and runs the following code n times
        .enter() // sees there are no h2 elements on the page, but it needs 9 (one for each piece of data in dataset)
        .append('h2').text('New Title')
