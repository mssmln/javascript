        The placement of a rectangle is handled by the x and y attributes. 
        They tell D3 where to start drawing the shape in the svg area. 
        The last challenge set them each to 0, so every bar was placed in the upper-left corner.
        For a bar chart, all of the bars should sit on the same vertical level, 
        which means the y value stays the same (at 0) for all bars. 
        The x value, however, needs to change as you add new bars. 
        Remember that larger x values push items farther to the right. 
        As you go through the array elements in dataset, the x value should increase.
