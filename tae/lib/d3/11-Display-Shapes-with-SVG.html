        The next step is to create a shape to put in the svg area. 
        When you place a shape into the svg area, you can specify where it goes with x and y coordinates. 
        The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. 
        Positive values for x push the shape to the right, and positive values for y push the shape down from the origin point.
        An SVG rect has four attributes. 
        There are the x and y coordinates for where it is placed in the svg area. 
        It also has a height and width to specify the size.
